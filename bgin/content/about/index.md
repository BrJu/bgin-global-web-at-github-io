**Blockchain Governance Initiative Network (BGIN)** aims at providing an open and neutral sphere for all stakeholders to deepen common understanding and to collaborate to address issues they face in order to attain sustainable development of the blockchain community. As an open network, we are now actively and widely seeking interested parties to join this initiative, so as to accommodate diverse opinions from a wider range of blockchain stakeholders. For those who are interested, please start contribution at the BGIN's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bgin-global) or contact us via  bgin-contact@bgin.team  &emsp;

### Purpose and tentative goals
&thinsp;  
As blockchain could affect a wide range of social and economic activities, the way we fulfill social interests in the financial system, which we currently depend on through regulation and its enforcement, may have to change as well. At this early stage of development, we ought to start designing a new mechanism to ensure the sustainable development of our new ecosphere by involving various stakeholders. 

The Blockchain Governance Initiative Network (BGIN), pronounced ‘BEGIN’, will take a leading role to design healthy governance where stakeholders develop a common understanding, enhance dialogue, and work together and make a real positive impact for the ecosphere and society at large.
To serve the above purpose, BGIN tentatively aims at

**1. Creating an open, global and neutral platform for multi-stakeholder dialogue**  
**2. Developing a common language and understandings among stakeholders with diverse perspectives**  
**3. Building academic anchors through continuous provision of trustable documents and codes based on an open source-style approach**&emsp;
